# New Issue

Hello, nkas.
Cause your fork repo has no `Issue` tab, so I send to you a message here.  
I know your project through this repo https://github.com/tainicom/Aether.Physics2D.  
But now, this repo has been archived with a lot of stars (347) on GitHub,   
You have forked it to continue to maintain and develop it.  

I do not know why you decided to achieve it and then fork a new one.  
But I feel the better way you can [transfer](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository) the project from https://github.com/tainicom to https://github.com/nkast  
This way can keep all its issues, pull requests, wiki, stars, contributors, and others. see https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository#whats-transferred-with-a-repository  
This way also helps your repo increase detection by GitHub search. instead of starting with only a few stars on GitHub search, that is waste effort
That makes it difficult for developers to reach your repo  

https://github.com/nkast/Aether.Extras is the same.  

Anyway, thank you.

# Features

- Continuous collision detection (with time of impact solver)
- Contact callbacks: begin, end, pre-solve, post-solve
- Convex and concave polyons and circles.
- Multiple shapes per body
- Dynamic tree and quad tree broadphase
- Fast broadphase AABB queries and raycasts
- Collision groups and categories
- Sleep management
- Friction and restitution
- Stable stacking with a linear-time solver
- Revolute, prismatic, distance, pulley, gear, mouse joint, and other joint types
- Joint limits and joint motors
- Controllers (gravity, force generators)
- Tools to decompose concave polygons, find convex hulls and boolean operations
- Factories to simplify the creation of bodies
